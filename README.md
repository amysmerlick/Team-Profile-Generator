# 🌺Team-Profile-Generator🌺

A Node.js command-line input application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

# Description

This application was created for a manager that would like to easily generate a webpage that displays their information and the information of their team. As a Node.js command line application, this generator presents the user with questions about their employees, their emails, and other information pertaining to their role and then uses the command line answers to create an HTML page. This application builds upon knowlege of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Jest (for testing), and the File System and Inquirer libraries from npm. When all information on the team member has been entered, the user is asked whether there are any more members they would like to add. If so, the user is asked the same questions about the new team member. If not, an HTML file is created with cards displaying the information on all the team members entered by the user in the "outputs" folder titled "team.html." A screenshot of an example team profile is shown below:
